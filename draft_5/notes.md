# Lucille

She is a quite woman. A slender Korean American, unconfident. She is walked all over at work despite her brilliance. She is in a relationship that lacks passion. She's just going along with the motions. She is just drifting through life with no idea of what she wants. And because she has nothing greater, no end vision to motivate the decisions she makes, nothing she does enhances her sense of self worth.

### Outer Motivation

To do X.

### Outer Conflict

Her job and family.

He financial situation.

The fact that she has no experience.

### Inner Motivation

To feel that her actions are within the context of achieving something greater, something that is inline with what she wants to give to the world. To feel excited by life and want things. To feel less depressed.

### Inner Conflict

She has always been bossed around. She has never been the one making decisions. Lack of self confidence.

# Outline

She works in an [office/factory/retail store]. Her boss is demanding and unappreciative.

She's married to Keith. He is self absorbed and sees her only as an extension of herself.

Her mother and father are overbearing.

She doesn't have anything in her life that is self-directed, and this is a source of depression for her.

Then she finds something. This *something* is still a little ambiguous, but it should be a response to the initial state. She will take control of her life by telling other people what to do. And by choosing to do this thing and going for it, she's also telling herself what to do for the first time. And if it could be focused around a still that she's be quietly/secretly developing over the years, either in her personal time or through her profession, that would be even tighter.

Maybe she wants to become a life coach? Or a director of something. Can't really move on until I decide what this is going to be.

I will not make this movie about a film maker.

Maybe she stumbles across a seminar for how to become a life coach. But why would this interest her. Maybe it's like a way of vicariously taking control. And she wants to help other people.

But does this really speak to the core of who she is? It would if she wants to help people. But if helping others is not at her core from the get go, then this won't be the strongest option.

Is she creative? And is her new desire to free her creative side?

Or is she a problem solver?

Or is she an educator?

Or is she a nurturer?

For some reason I feel like she's a helper. I feel like she cares about others.

Keith is the person that her parents wanted her to marry. He is the representation of their ideal. Successful, high status, money, etc. He is their perfect son in law.

Who does she want to help? Other people like her?

Her goal is to become a life coach.

I think right now it is very important for me to describe my objective with this film so that when I get to the point where I'm reconsidering whether or not "becoming a life coach" is the right thing for her to want, I can have an understanding of what I'm trying to do.

# Objective

I want to tell a story about a person who transitions between a state of not having a purpose in life to discovering a purpose and/or source of self fulfillment and going for it.

# X: the thing.

I was thinking life coach because it kind of makes sense for the situation that I think she's in. But the problem with that is I don't really think that would be a fun screenplay to write. I'm facing a moment where I want to "follow the fun", and I don't think that there is that much fun down that road... or at least not the maximum amount. This is the reason why I'm still in the outlining phase, or why I'm dragging this outlining phase out so long; I have the beginnings of a character - some critical elements of her backstory and initial situation, as well as a rough idea of what her external motivation will be - but I don't have a concept that I'm in love with.

I feel like the concept is how I become interested. I think that's why Agony has remained interesting to me over these past two years. The concept of the infinite possibilities of simulation and computer-brain-interface technologies provides me with limitless creative possibilities. I need to find the equivalent of that in this world.

I'm tempted to go back to this idea that I originally had of Lucille becoming a director of porno movies. I think that this is way more interesting. It has the potential to be fun. Also, I think in a lot of ways this checks off the boxes of a perfect progression - it's a direct rebellion against the images that her family has created for her, it's a creative outlet, it's allowing her to take control of her own life and tell herself what to do by directing others. Pretty good. Okay, let's go for it!

# Outline

Her husband works in finance and is a big shot at his firm. Her parents are well to do and both equally successful, retired lawyers maybe. She is an executive assistant at her husbands firm. She looks super hollow and beaten down by life.

She's in the therapist office and the therapist is talking to her about her progress with depression. She is saying that she doesn't feel any better. The therapist says that she should pick an activity, something that interests her. That it might be a path toward a sense of purpose.

She's at work and it's the same old shit.

She's walking down the street and passes a camera store. Why film photography? Maybe the guy at the camera store suggested it because she said she wanted something that would distract her or preoccupy her or take up a lot of time - she says something to this camera store guy which leads him to suggest a film camera.

She reluctantly takes photos. They're uninspired and it seems as though she's taking pictures reluctantly.

Her family makes fun of her for her stupidly chosen hobby.

She picks up a role of film and a creepy guy at the lab makes a comment about one of the pictures she took.

She is at work one day and she stumbles upon two lovers having sex. It is a forbidden love. They are both married. She takes pictures of them.

She goes to the lab but when she sees the creepy guy through the window she stops. She's at home and develops the pictures taking care to follow the instructions exactly. She views the images and is fascinated by them.

Then around her family she's different. Instead of being hollow, she's distracted by the thought of these two.

At work, she's trying to find them again. She does. She takes more pictures but they find her. They're really mad and he grabs her camera and smashes it and tells her to get lost.

She's back at home with her family and she's completely broken, dead inside. More so than before, actually depressed.

She's in the therapist office and the therapist asks her if she's found a hobby. She says no.

She's at work and they approach her. They actually got the film developed and love the pictures she took. They ask her if she would like to film them. She agrees.

Now she's planning the film. They're rehearsing or doing whatever people would do to prepare for such a film.

What are the obstacles she faces during this phase? What is she up against here? Resulting from her decision to renounce photography, there must be something else that comes up that 

Then her husband and her parents find out. And they shun her. They tell her that if she goes through with it that they'll disown her. (Goes through with what? How will they know that she's making a sex film. Maybe they walk in on the filming of it?)

They are all ashamed of her and the couple is now completely discouraged. No one really wants anything to do with her. But she realizes that she this is important to her and working toward this has given her such a sense of purpose and excited her about life so much that she has to go for it. So she finds them and convinces them to do it. (What are they going to get out of it? She must see something in them that's lacking and realize/convinces them that this is a way for them to grow.)

But even though they decide to go through with it, there is still a massive hurdle. Maybe there is an ameatue adult film movie contest and she convinces them that they should enter.

She goes to church with her husband and her parents. He is singing loud. Her parents are singing loud. She is singing quietly and is distracted, looking at something else. This is the meeting hall.

After church they have lunch. Her parents are so proud of him. Wesley. He is the son they never had. He tells everyone about how great things are going at work and they praise him. They ask her how work is going for her. She says that it's the same and doesn't elaborate.

She commutes to the city for work.

She works in a big office with a lot of loud, confident types.

She has

# Other Characters

### Walter

He is a church man but also a financial man. He's a partner at his firm. What does he want? Whatever his motivation turns out to be, he's going to force it onto her.

### Mom and Dad

Let's just remember that they are there but we might not need them yet. They're kind of just backup/support for Walter and his motivations.

### Anton and Shauna

Since these two people are elements of Lucille's work environment, we have to decide what that environment really is before we can undertsnd what roles they play in that environment.
