# Chapter 3 Notes

How do we move her forward to the attempted suicide? What makes *me* feel like killing myself? How do I feel when I want my life to be over?

I feel like I just want the current feeling to stop. I don't want to feel *that* anymore.

So if we are to really believe in her desire to kill herself, if we are really going to empathize, we need to get a good sense of what the feeling is, how intense it is and how it affects her, how it negatively impacts her well-being. Additionally, we need to understand that there is nothing she can do (at least nothing she is aware of) to change her situation; no action she can take to make the bad feeling go away, except to just end the whole thing.

She has to feel like she is powerless to make change. Change from what? What is she feeling exactly?? Isolation? Yes - there is no one for her to talk to about this and she also doubts that anyone else feels like this. Fear? Yes - she thinks there's something wrong with her.

There has to be a a moment where she's caught and the church finds out about her porn obsession.

The church intervenes and starts "healing". Luckily, there is one good person in her world that is kind of friends with her. Maybe it's a doorman or something. Anyway, through this person she discovers the therapist. And the therapist is where the A story changes.

### Money problems, marital problems.

Walter has lost his job. Now she is the bread winner in the house. He is worry personified. All he does is pray. He begs the lord (and also pretty much threatens her) to get that promotion because the extra income could really help in a time like this.

On her way to work, she imagines people on the sidewalk fucking as she waits at the light. She gets to work and imagines people in her office fucking as she opens the elevator.

Then, when she gets to work, she watches porn on her phone behind the reception desk.

She goes home to find prayer meeting at their house. Her parents are there as well as Walter. Her mom gives her money but makes her feel terrible about it.

The next day at work she doesn't get the promotion. She gets home and Walter is just standing there with her collection of porn on the table.
