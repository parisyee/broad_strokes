She's not ever sure why she would make him wait instead of jumping into prayer enthusiastically. It makes no difference to her. And if she's not gaining any pleasure from the act, they what's the point? Perhaps this act of passive aggression is a relic from a time when something like this would make her happy. When messing with Walter would make her laugh or curl her lips into a smile or raise her brow. But no longer. Those days are behind here. And the ones ahead are on autopilot.

What does she do here? This is where we have to reveal something about her life that let's us know what she's up against. What is the conflict. What does her mom want her do to? What does work want her to do? What emotions do I want the reader to feel here? What emotions did I want the reader to feel in the previous section? Discomfort. Monotony. I want you to feel what she feels. And she feels like this life is never going to end.

We need to impose some want here. She can't be totally wantless. There has to be *something* that's going to provide the suspense, *something* that's going to make us wonder "what's gonna happen next?".

> Maybe all she wants is for all the struggle to end. 

Or, is there a way to build suspense without her having to want anything? Is there a way to just have her going through her day and for us to wonder, based solely on her situation, what's going to happen? 

If I want to get her to the place where she tries to commit suicide, there better be a hell of a lot of reason for her to do this. We have to feel like this is a real choice that this person would make. We have to almost get behind her. Maybe think - if I were in her shoes, I might consider killing myself. So what are all of the things that are stacked up against her? We have to build this up from the get go.

1. Money - Her and Walter are in debt. There are collection agencies calling the house. Foreclosure notice.
2. Job - Maybe it's degrading and she has no power and also doesn't get paid well. Maybe she's a maid or a lunch lady or something.
3. Parent's and husband are overbearing and the put her down.

#### Things that need to happen in this chapter

We have to have a timely understanding of her money problems. They're going to foreclose on her house. There are debt collectors calling. Or maybe one point of this could be that you can get to this state without any money problems at all. It's all about how people treat her. In fact, lets turn that into a part of the problem. Her and Walter are doing very well financially, but that's all because of him. He makes all the money. And he hangs it over her head, reminding her the she's living on his dime every chance he gets.

Her parents do the same thing. And there has always been such a huge focus on money that she's never had the opportunity to explore what she really wants. She was forced to study finance. And because she has such an ineptitude for the subject, she's never been able to secure a good job. Barely passing her undergraduate courses and now working as a secretary for higher-ups at a reputable firm. Not sure yet whether she works for Walter's firm or at a different firm. If she works at his firm, we have the opportunity for him to not stick up for her when she's getting berated by a higher-up.

This chapter will end with her attempting to kill herself.
