# Chapter 1

​	The low humming drone of the ceiling fan envelops the second floor master bedroom of 54 Stamford Drive. It's 5:59 a.m. and the pinkish, orangish glow of the mornings first rays just begin to permeate the long, sheer curtains. It's a large room with few furnishings. The bulky pieces, all of the same Ethan Allen set, are like a kindred group of distant islands, dotting the featureless sea of beige wall-to-wall carpeting that underscores the vacuous room. This is not a homy place, this is a model home.

​	Vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum.

​	Atop the bed, staring at the fan blade with wide-open eyes, lies Lucille Kwan. Like the room in which she finds herself, Lucille is not comfortable or homy. Her night attire is presentable almost to the point of being formal. One might look upon Lucille in this instance and wonder what happened to her. Why would a person with such nice pajamas, lying on a California king with silk sheets which itself is situated in the middle of a room so large that *it* must be part of a house of significant size - why would someone like that be so widely awake at this early hour of the morning? So widely awake and in seemingly such deep contemplation at 5:59 in the morning. I don't really know. I have a few guesses, sure. There are a number of elements in her life, some usual suspects that one could easily blame for laying the psychological foundation for such a restless disposition. One such element, in fact, is immediately left of her. Walter Kwan, sporting an equally formal pajama outfit, sleeps like a baby in a half curled position. He's on the shorter side, has a wide frame - not fat, but solid - and a crew cut like a military man.

​	The alarm clock rings - 6:00 a.m. Walter stirs for a moment, then sits up. He looks at Lucille with tired, uninterested eyes, as if the fact that she's obviously been lying awake for some time is actually nothing out of the ordinary.

​	"Morning", he yawns. 

​	Walter steps out of bed and lets loose a big, satisfying stretch of the arms overhead. With this, his eyes light up. "Oh, Lord Jesus", he murmurs warmly. Then, he kneels down at the side of the bed, clasps his hands together and bows his head. 

​	"Oh, Lord Jesus. Oh, Lord Jesus!"

​	He pauses his God chanting and looks up at Lucille who seems not to have registered any of the events of the past ninety seconds. She just continues to start at, or perhaps even past that ceiling fan spinning and humming away. I've been watching Lucille for a while now, and I know that she's unhappy. She often drifts off into these spells of distraction, losing all sense of presence and immediacy. I really can't say for certain what she's thinking about in these moments, but if I had to guess, I think it might have something to do with the fact that she doesn't really like anything about her life. Not anything at all.

​	"Lucille", urges Walter.

​	Slowly, Lucille rolls her head to face her husband with the same blank stare she's been directing at the ceiling fan for the past few minutes. Without saying a word, she cranks herself out of bed and takes her place kneeling on the opposite side of the mattress across from Walter. Walter's mouth curls into a satisfactory smirk. He casts a jovial look at his wife across the bed who's vacuous expression is still unchanged. He bows his head again and starts calling "Oh, Lord, Jesus". Lucille sighs deeply, then bows her head to mirror Walter.

​	"Oh. Lord. Jesus", exclaims Walter.

​	Lucille murmurs in replie, "Amen".

​	Then Walter: "Oh! Lord! Jesus!".

​	And Lucille: "Amen".

​	Walter: "Oh, Lord Jesus. Thank you for this day. Thank you for all that you have given to us, Lord."

​	Lucille: "Amen".

​	Walter: "We hope that this day we may live in your light!"

​	Lucille: "Amen".

​	Walter continues to pray emphatically, thanking God for everything on the planet and pledging to do his dirty work. And as he does, Lucille just stares blankly, mindlessly repeating "Amen" at Walter's every pause for breath, wondering how she got here. In a few moments it will be her turn to pray. And, as always, she'll play along and tell God an Walter all the things they want to hear. Prayer on autopilot -  a skill she perfected as a child while under the rule of mom an dad. A useful skill, an efficiency mechanism that allows her mind to contemplate other things; "What shall I wear to work today? How many more days can I go without returning my mother's call?" And even, "is today the day I kill myself?".

​	It's not long before it's her turn. Walter concludes his prayer with a "Lord, Jesus, I love you. Amen." A period of silence passes, one that's just a little too long for Walter's comfort. "How dare she make the Lord wait? I bet she's fallen asleep as she kneels at the bed?". His patience expires and he lifts his head, looking up from his hands across the bed at his wife to discover what on earth she could be waiting for. And just as he does she begins reciting her script.

​	"Oh, Lord Jesus.", utters Lucille in a strong, yet hushed voice. Walter, assuaged, bows his head back toward his clasped hands. "Amen!", he proclaims.

​	Lucille often toys with her husband in this way. A small pleasure in an otherwise bleak and passionless marriage. But the pleasure is short lived. The high achieved by ruffling his feathers is indeed an ephemeral one. And as the small bit of joy evaporates, it leaves in its place a hole that is quickly filled with the feelings of want and depression that are her standard. In fact, from the perspective of an outsider, it would have been impossible to discern that this minuscule act of passive aggression had yielded any pleasure at all. For all the while, the appearance of our Lucille had not altered from her original hollow, almost lifeless gaze. Not even slightly. Anything, even the faintest smirk, the smallest lift of an eyebrow would be enough to make us feel like everything is okay. But as I mentioned before, Lucille is not a happy person. My best guess is that these subtle acts of defiance, these micro annoyances that she plants in Walters path every so often are habits that she developed some time ago. Habits that, at the time they were born, must have amused her and brought he some deal of pleasure. But over time their power for amusement waned. And now she does these things without even thinking. Instead now, she does this not for the joy, but to remind her that she has any power at all.

​	She finishes her prayer. Walter stands up and goes to the bathroom. Lucille stays kneeling at the bed staring blankly. The sounds of the shower turning on and Walter starting to sing a hymn as he steps in have no effect on her. She just stays there kneeling at the side of the mattress.



Lucille is thirty-three. She's been married for three years. They met in church five years ago, at church. Lucille has been in the church life since before she can remember. Her parents - exuberant and relentless members of the Reform Church of Christ Jesus our Lord, Franklin Park, New Jersey branch - have been shlepping her her to church since her infancy. Children meeting on Sundays as a toddler and through elementary school, and then once she began her teenage years, young peoples prayer meetings on Wednesday and Friday nights, as well as young peoples fellowship on Sunday mornings. After graduating high school - The Lord's Table meeting on Sunday mornings which was just for adults, as well as the full gamut of weeknight fellowship and prayer meetings.

Like anyone who's grow up in a religious household, Lucille was never asked if she wanted to attend. Her interest was always just assumed. Her mother and father were far more interested in coming off as the perfect christian family than understanding and satisfying the true desires of their daughter. Since before Lucille was born, Timmothy and Esther Wong have held a sort of power couple status in their church, always trying to outperform the average brother or sister - hosting one or two extra home meetings per month, bringing a slightly bigger portion of Shepard's Pie to the potlucks or being the first to volunteer to host that visiting family from the whichever of the many sister fellowships across the country.

Timmothy and Esther were not very nice to Lucille, nor are they now. Their mini empire of five laundromats kept them ever busy and they didn't have enough free time to consider their daughters wishes (not that they would have necessarily been inclined to even if they had the time). Since she was very young, Lucille had been groomed for a career in finance. Banker, broker, trader, fund manager, analyst - to Timmothy and Esther, it didn't matter; just as their daughter would grow up to be a devout servant of God, she would grow up to be a rich and successful financial professional.

​	Having been conditioned to know this as her true destiny, Lucille never once imagined a life where she did not pursue this dream of her parents. Going against the word of your parents was only second worst to going agains the word of God, after all. Alternate career paths never entered her mind as possibilities. But as it turns out, Lucille is actually the least qualified person to develop a thriving career in finance. For one, she's terrible at math which rules her out of any sort of technical or analytical position. Secondly, she's always been a quiet, meek person. This is possibly due to the fact that every opinion she ever had - what might be an interesting job when she grew up, why leaves were green, that she would like to have a little brother or sister to play with - had been shot down either by her parents or the church. By the time she turned seventeen, she'd learned it was just easier if she didn't have opinions.

​	She had managed to get into business school and studied economics. But she struggled with the course work tremendously (as one usually does when pursuing a major for which she is completely inept in order to satisfy the wished of her parents). Still tough, she managed to graduate and even land a job at a reputable firm; albeit, as an office secretary.

​	Lucille has dreaded this job from the day she started. Here bosses, in many ways, were an extension of her parents. Always commanding and demanding, never interested in her opinions, and frank to the point of being cruel. It seemed that Lucille would never escape this type of treatment. It seemed as though she was destined to live a life where she was always told what to do.

​	Then five years ago, Walter moved to town. He'd come from the west coast. Walter had found the church when he was sixteen. A neglected, poor and troubled youth with no prospects, the church provided him with structure and community that he needed in order to work toward a better future. By the time he was in his early twenties, he'd become one of the most active and passionate members of the Burbank branch. The sense of empowerment the he'd fostered since joining the church gave him the courage to apply to business school. He was one of the top students of his class. He landed a job at one of the top investment banks, and after traveling and building his reputation within the company, he decided it was time to settle down. He moved to Franklin Park for it's proximity to New York City, where his offices were, and the church. Then he met Lucille.

​	Immediately upon meeting him and learning of his story, Timmothy and Esther Wong had become fascinated with Walter. His success, his devotion, his confidence, it was everything they wanted their Lucille to be. The Wong's would have traded their daughter for Walter if they could. But realizing that was impractical they did the next best thing and poured every ounce of their energy into arranging their union. No small feet considering their shy and plain looking daughter had a miraculous ability for going completely unnoticed by most people. Still though, after seeding and perpetuating many rumors of romantic interest and attraction throughout the various cliques of the congregation, Lucille and Walter quickly found themselves in awkward conversation. Conversation turned to dating and dating turned to marriage.

​	Walter and Lucille never really cared much for each other. In the beginning, they didn't mind each other so much. But they certainly did not share the sort of uncontrollable attraction that you might expect to find in the early days of most romantic relationships. For Walter, marriage was just one more necessary step towards matching his reality with his perception of what a successful investment banker and devout God-man looked like. And for Lucille, their union was mainly just a means of appeasing her parents, a desperate attempt to quell their incessant nagging.

​	It shouldn't come as a surprise then that the couple's marriage is hollow, their intimate love life nonexistent, and their cohabitation a social formality.
