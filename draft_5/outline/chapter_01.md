# Chapter 1

The low humming drone of the ceiling fan envelops the second floor master bedroom of 54 Stamford Drive. It's 5:59 a.m. and the pinkish, orangish glow of the mornings first rays just begin to permeate the long, sheer curtains. It's a large room with few furnishings. The bulky pieces, all of the same Ethan Allen set, are like a kindred group of distant islands, dotting the featureless sea of beige wall-to-wall carpeting that underscores the vacuous room. This is not a homy place, this is a model home.

Vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum, vhum.

Atop the bed, staring at the fan blade with wide-open eyes, lies Lucille Kwan. Like the room in which she finds herself, Lucille is not comfortable or homy. Her night attire is presentable almost to the point of being formal. One might look upon Lucille in this instance and wonder what happened to her. Why would a person with such nice pajamas, lying on a California king with silk sheets which itself is situated in the middle of a room so large that *it* must be part of a house of significant size - why would someone like that be so widely awake at this early hour of the morning? So widely awake and in seemingly such deep contemplation at 5:59 in the morning. I don't really know. I have a few guesses, sure. There are a number of elements in her life, some usual suspects that one could easily blame for laying the psychological foundation for such a restless disposition. One such element, in fact, is immediately left of her. Walter Kwan, sporting an equally formal pajama outfit, sleeps like a baby in a half curled position. He's on the shorter side, has a wide frame - not fat, but solid - and a crew cut like a military man.

The alarm clock rings - 6:00 a.m. Walter stirs for a moment, then sits up. He looks at Lucille with tired, uninterested eyes, as if the fact that she's obviously been lying awake for some time is actually nothing out of the ordinary.

"Morning", he yawns. 

Walter steps out of bed and lets loose a big, satisfying stretch of the arms overhead. With this, his eyes light up. "Oh, Lord Jesus", he murmurs warmly. Then, he kneels down at the side of the bed, clasps his hands together and bows his head. 

"Oh, Lord, Jesus. Oh, Lord, Jesus!"

He pauses his God chanting and looks up at Lucille who seems not to have registered any of the events of the past ninety seconds. She just continues to start at, or perhaps even past that ceiling fan spinning and humming away. I've been watching Lucille for a while now, and I know that she's unhappy. She often drifts off into these spells of distraction, losing all sense of presence and immediacy. I really can't say for certain what she's thinking about in these moments, but if I had to guess, I think it might have something to do with the fact that she doesn't really like anything about her life. Not anything at all.

"Lucille", urges Walter.

Slowly, Lucille rolls her head to face her husband with the same blank stare she's been directing at the ceiling fan for the past few minutes. Without saying a word, she cranks herself out of bed and takes her place kneeling on the opposite side of the mattress across from Walter. Walter's mouth curls into a satisfactory smirk. He casts a jovial look at his wife across the bed who's vacuous expression is still unchanged. He bows his head again and starts calling "Oh, Lord, Jesus". Lucille sighs deeply, then bows her head to mirror Walter.

"Oh, Lord, Jesus", exclaims Walter.

Lucille murmurs in replie, "Amen".

Then Walter: "Oh, Lord, Jesus!".

And Lucille: "Amen".

Walter: "Oh, Lord Jesus. Thank you for this day. Thank you for all that you have given to us, Lord."

Lucille: "Amen".

Walter: "We hope that this day we may live in your light!"

Lucille: "Amen".

Walter continues to pray emphatically. and Lucille continues to
