# Chapter 2

​	The main meeting hall of *The Church in New York City, Christian Fellowship Center* - the Queens branch of what can most succinctly be described as a flavor of Restorationism similar, at least at a glance, to Jehovah's Witnesses - reverberated with the group droning of hymns being sung in unison. Looking upon the massive room, one might be reminded of a large convention center conference room; the thirty-foot ceiling, retractable accordion-style partitioning walls, beige low-pile carpeting and, of course, thousand or so stackable, thinly-padded metal chairs of the Queens Fellowship Center probably wouldn't conjure thoughts of *Church* in the classical sense, at least not to most. But the booming audience, a plain-faced and frumpily-dressed crowd, bellowed just as loudly and sounded just as unpleasantly out of tune as even the most stereotypical millenarian denominations, if not more so.

> Remove my covering, Lord
>
> That I may see Thy light and be deceived no more
>
> But all things see aright.
>
> But all things see aright.

​	Amongst the hundreds of church goers, dead center in the middle of the pack, stood Lucille Kwan. It was easy to pick her out of the crowd. Her mouth sagged with apathy as she quietly forced out the lyrics to the hymn. Her eyes were fixed blankly toward the front of the hall in a lackluster gaze. On this gray Sunday morning in late October, Lucille was bored, as she had been on every Sunday morning since she could remember. And it was Lucille's boredom, that put her in such stark contrast with the rest of the church goers. You would only have to look for a moment to realize that she was the odd one out, that she was the only one who, through a combination of posture and expression, appeared to regard her surroundings with pure and utter disinterest.

​	To Lucilles right was Walter, her husband. Walter was on the shorter and broader side, standing just a hair taller than Lucille. Unlike his wife, he stood proud and sang with passion and fervor, exclaiming the precious verses with wide open mouth and closed eyes.

​	On Lucilles left side was her mother and father, Timothy and Esther. Like their son-in-law, they too stood proud and sang out from the depths of their bellies with closed eyes.

[Describe these people to the point of hilarity]

>  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord
>
> Scatter all my night, Lord
>
> And everything make bright, Lord
>
> For this I pray to Thee.

As they're singing, Lucille drops her hymnal. 

​	In the front of the hall, as the tone-deaf lulling came to a halt, a short old man with gray pants and a dark blue jacket made his way up the tiny step-pyramid-style stage and grabbed the microphone.

​	"Amen! Thank you brothers and sisters," the man exclaims. The thin sheet of black hair covering his large bald area had flopped into his eyes on his way up to the stage; he brushes it back into place as he organizes his notes at the podium.

​	Realizing their cue, the audience all at once takes their seats. Lucille, still staring off into space doesn't notice. The man in front of her sits and his back bumps Lucilles hymnal, which had been half-way supported by this chair for the past twenty minutes, out of her loose grip onto the floor. Snapping out of her daydream, she snaps down to retrieve the fallen book and, in doing so, knocks her forehead hard agains the back of the mans skull.

​	"Oh!" Scoffs the man as he turns in annoyance.

​	"Sorry!", whispers Lucille, embarrassed, as she sinks into her seat. Esther, having whiteness the whole awkward moment, flanks her daughters arm with her hymnal. "Be quiet!"

 	The old Brother Benjamin begins to speak.











​	The song ends. Brother Benjamin gets up and starts preaching. He gets to a part of the sermon where he explains something about man and woman. Then Sister Sarah gets up on the stage and they start making out. Finally they get to fucking.

​	Then Lucille snaps out of it because he mom hits her again for not paying attention. We realize it was all in her head.
