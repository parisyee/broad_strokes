# Chapter 2

​	The main meeting hall of *The Church in New York City, Christian Fellowship Center* - the Queens branch of what can most succinctly be described as a flavor of Restorationism similar, at least at a glance, to Jehovah's Witnesses - reverberated with the group droning of hymns being sung in unison. Looking upon the massive room, one might be reminded of a large convention center conference room; the thirty-foot ceiling, retractable accordion-style partitioning walls, beige low-pile carpeting and, of course, thousand or so stackable, thinly-padded metal chairs of the Queens Fellowship Center probably wouldn't conjure thoughts of *Church* in the classical sense, at least not to most. But the booming audience, a plain-faced and frumpily-dressed crowd, bellowed just as loudly and sounded just as unpleasantly out of tune as even the most stereotypical millenarian denominations, if not more so.

> Remove my covering, Lord
>
> That I may see Thy light and be deceived no more
>
> But all things see aright.
>
> But all things see aright.

​	Amongst the hundreds of church goers, dead center in the middle of the pack, stood Lucille Kwan. It was easy to pick her out of the crowd. Her mouth sagged with apathy as she quietly forced out the lyrics to the hymn. Her eyes were fixed blankly toward the front of the hall in a lackluster gaze. On this gray Sunday morning in late October, Lucille was bored, as she had been on every Sunday morning since she could remember. And it was Lucille's boredom, that put her in such stark contrast with the rest of the church goers. You would only have to look for a moment to realize that she was the odd one out, that she was the only one who, through a combination of posture and expression, appeared to regard her surroundings with pure and utter disinterest.

​	To Lucilles right was Walter, her husband. Walter was on the shorter and broader side, standing just a hair taller than Lucille. Unlike his wife, he stood proud and sang with passion and fervor, exclaiming the precious verses with wide open mouth and closed eyes.

​	On Lucilles left side was her mother and father, Timothy and Esther. Like their son-in-law, they too stood proud and sang out from the depths of their bellies with closed eyes.

[Describe these people to the point of hilarity]

>  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord
>
> Scatter all my night, Lord
>
> And everything make bright, Lord
>
> For this I pray to Thee.

As they're singing, Lucille drops her hymnal. 

​	In the front of the hall, as the tone-deaf lulling came to a halt, a short old man with gray pants and a dark blue jacket made his way up the tiny step-pyramid-style stage and grabbed the microphone.

​	"Amen! Thank you brothers and sisters," the man exclaims. The thin sheet of black hair covering his large bald area had flopped into his eyes on his way up to the stage; he brushes it back into place as he organizes his notes at the podium.

​	Realizing their cue, the audience all at once takes their seats. Lucille, still staring off into space doesn't notice. The man in front of her sits and his back bumps Lucilles hymnal, which had been half-way supported by this chair for the past twenty minutes, out of her loose grip onto the floor. Snapping out of her daydream, she snaps down to retrieve the fallen book and, in doing so, knocks her forehead hard agains the back of the mans skull.

​	"Oh!" Scoffs the man as he gives an venomous half turn.

​	"Sorry!", whispers Lucille, embarrassed. She curls back into her seat. Esther, having whiteness the whole awkward moment, flanks her daughter's arm with her hymnal. "Be quiet!"

 	The old Brother Benjamin begins to speak.

<-- TODO: Read the bible. What does Benjamin talk about? !-->

​	Most of the congregation open their bibles to follow along. They all read together.

​	"...[reading ending]. Is this not beautiful?! Here, [person] says [thing], and to him God replies [other thing]. Brothers and Sisters, this is God's grace."

​	"Amen!", the crowd roars in unison.

​	"[Then her says something else]"

​	"Amen!" The crowd is not electrified. 

​	"Let's have an example. Sister Marleen has agreed to help me this morning. Would you come up up here Sister?", A woman in the front row rises and approaches the Benjamin on stage. She's in great shape for sixty, though her hide skirt suit and bangs make it nearly impossibly to appreciate it. "Let's give Sister Marleen our biggest *Oh Lord, amen, hallelujah*!", says Benjamin. 

​	The crowd roars, "Oh, Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!"

​	He dismounts the microphone from the podium and, like a daytime gameshow host, extends his hand toward Sister Marleen as she approaches. They join hands in the middle of the stage. Marleen is cheery, not at all bashful about getting up in front of everyone. She bows her heads slightly to greet the crowd.

​	"See, when God [... more stuff that I have to research ...]". As he talks, Marleen's - very slowly and without drawing much attention to her actions - begins her hand closes Benjamin on the small of his back. This is not merely a quick pat, a "glory to you, dear brother, for inviting me on stage this week". No, this is a lingering touch. The sister's hand stays planted, softly, yet securely, on the lower region of the church elder's back. Then, her other hand begins to gently glide up and down Benjamins arm. As she strokes him, he leans into her a bit, creating some additional pressure between their bodies.

​	Lucille looks around. It seems that no one seems to notice this except her. She turns to her mother. Nothing. Esther just stares ahead, nodding agreeably along with the old Benjamin as he speaks. Lucille looks back toward the front of the hall to find Marleen now unbuttoning Benjamin's blazer.

​	"[... More gospel talk ...]". He switches hands with the microphone to remove his arms from his jacket sleeves. As he and Marleen fumble to get his jacket off, Benjamin also starts slipping off his loafers. "[... and more ...]"

​	No one in the the large hall seems to take any note of this activity on stage. They all just continues to sit and stare and read along and jot notes in the margins of their heavily marked bibles. No one except Lucille. He eyes race around the room in the hope of finding another individual who is seems as perplexed as she is feels. But there is none. Everyone just sits there, business as usual.

​	By now, Marleen has removed Benjamin's jacket as well as her own, and she's begun unbuttoning Benjamin's shirt. Over the next few minutes, Sister Marleen succeeds in completely stripping both herself and Benjamin down to nothing. Ass-naked, the pair stand on stage as if nothing is going on.

​	[... Benjamin gives some sort of closing remark ...]

​	The whole congregation erupts, "Amen!"

​	Benjamin walks over to the podium and replaces the microphone. Then he rejoins Sister Marleen in the center of the stage. She takes his hand and leads him, stage left to the grand piano. They work together to close the top, and in a team effort of elderly strength, the two manage to get Marleen seated on top of the piano. She sits with her legs dangling off. Then she lays back and hoists her legs up so her feet are flat on the piano and her knees are bent. In one fluid motion, Benjamin hunches over, threads his between Marleen legs and hooks around her thighs. Gripping her, he bows his head and begins eating her out. Marleen looks down at him with a pleased smirk before letting her eyes roll back into her head in relaxation.

​	This goes on uninterrupted for a few seconds, then suddenly a middle-aged woman near the front jolts to her feet and proclaims "Oh, Lord Jesus!"

​	Without losing a beat, the rest of the congregation replies with a thundering, "Amen!"

​	The same woman shouts again, "Oh, Lord Jesus!"

​	"Amen!"

​	Then a young man near the back stands and shouts "Oh, Lord Jesus!"

​	And again, the whole meeting all replies, "Amen!"

​	More church goers follow suite until eventually every single person is on their feet and all are chanting in one continuous loop:

​	"Oh, Lord Jesus! Amen!"

​	"Oh, Lord Jesus! Amen!"

​	"Oh, Lord Jesus! Amen!"

​	By now, Benjamin has Marleen bent over the piano and is fucking her from behind. He shouts above everyone else. "Oh, Lord Jesus! We consecrate this life to you!"

​	"Amen!"

​	"[... More stuff ...]"

​	"Amen!"

​	The hall is electrified by the collective energy. Everyone, a component of the hive mind. Everyone except Lucille. She just stands there, staring in awe at the scene which has unfolded at the front of the hall. If you looked into the eyes of any other member of this church, it would be impossible to discern from their gaze that such an act of shameless hedonism was taking place. But look into the eyes of Lucille and you'll be overwhelmed with a sense of heavy fixation. While the others chant their praise (as if the slamming of Benjamin and Marleen's wrinkled bodies were a X), Lucille ...



<-- Then Lucille snaps out of it because he mom hits her again for not paying attention. We realize it was all in her head. -->
