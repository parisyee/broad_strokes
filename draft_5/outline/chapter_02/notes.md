The first half of the first act, up to the suicide attempt, is going to be spent introducing the controlling/oppressive forces in her life - Walter, Mom & Dad, and the powers at work.

I think this chapter is going to be about Walter. They're eating breakfast - they both eat separate breakfasts. He's telling her what she should do. With regards to what? Maybe it would be interesting if everyone was telling her how to do the same think. Like there was a decision she has to make and both her parents and Walter are telling her how she should make the decision.

Maybe she has a performance review meeting and they are going to renegotiate her compensation.

I really don't know what the details of this part should be, but I know how I want it to feel; I want us to feel the sort of trapped misery that she feels. Or maybe this is more like boredom. Maybe its boring while at the same time having these overbearing figures and the combination of that makes her miserable.

They eat cereal every morning. Walter only wears gray suits. She drives a beige Hyundai. She does data entry. She just sits at a computer entering numbers from stacks of paper into a computer. She's not in finance at all. She has a government job or works for a data provider. The sky is always gray. The food is always bland.

Okay, so what actually happens in this chapter? What moves the story forward? What does she have to do?

So maybe we need to anticipate what's going to happen at work. What is going to happen at work? She's going to get demoted? Her life is going to get even more boring somehow?

What are the main things she's going through in the beginning? Boredom and lack of purpose. So something that happens at work has to make her life seem even more boring and less purposeful. If she's already doing a boring, purposeless job - data entry for digital advertising purposes (or something even more useless to society) - then how can that become even worse?

How can her marriage become even more passionless? How can her relationship with her parents become even more intolerable?

I think the first sequence should be on a Sunday. We come in on them at church and we get exposed to how passionless she is about the church life. They go out to lunch with mom and dad and we get a taste of them. Then at night, we see how detached she is from Walter. And maybe he's not some huge financial success. Maybe he also works for the government or is an accountant or something. But at lunch we seed the idea that there is opportunity for her to have something that she is more excited for at work. She has a meeting the next day about a new position that is open and she thinks they're going give it to her because she's worked out in her head that she's the perfect fit. She assesses the qualities that she believes an ideal candidate would have and matches them up with her own qualities and sees it as a perfect fit. This is only her assumption though; there was nothing from anyone at work that would indicate this possibility. And maybe her parents even question this, bringing up this very point.

So the next day she is at work. And its time for her meeting. But they tell her that she's going to be doing a different job. A more boring one. And while she's driving home from work her mom calls and asks her about the job. She tells her she didn't get it and then her mom starts yelling at her - I told you x, y, z. She hangs up the phone, then starts to have a panic attack, and drives her car into wall.

Then the next scene is of her in the therapist office.

# okay...

She's a deprived sex addict. She's at the biggest conflict. In the meeting she thinks about sex. She hides the porn that she watches.

So what's the outline of this chapter? We come in with a description of the meeting hall and the people. And while she's there she gets lost in a daydream about two other people having sex. That is what makes her such a unique character; she doesn't fantasize about herself having sex. She doesn't even get aroused. That's not what the story is about. What makes her the perfect person to direct porn is her fascination, nay, her obsession with watching/imagining *other people* having sex.

She imagines Brother Benjamin and Sister Sarah getting it on. She paints this whole scene and we think it's real until we find out that this was a day dream she was having while the hymns were going on.
